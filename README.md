Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality systems. Software Engineering is important in tacking current world issues and helps in making everyone's life easier and simpler

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design - Creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
Implementation - Writing code and building software according to the design specifications
Testing - Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment - Releasing the software to customers
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support and updates to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall involves a sequential approach with distinct phases during development. It may include requirements, design, implementation, etc.
Agile however involves the iterative and incremental approach to development which focuses on flexibility, collaboration and response to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution  and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes, eg, Visual Studio
VCS are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, eg, GIT, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debts are some commmon challenges which can be overcome by making sure there is proper planning, work is done according to the budget and having a good team behind you/ 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - Testing individual components or modules of software
Intergration testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing = Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best response from your AI assistant.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
